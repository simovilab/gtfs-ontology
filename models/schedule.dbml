Stations and parentless stops with empty stop_timezone inherit the timezone specified by agency.agency_timezone. The times provided in stop_times.txt are in the timezone specified by agency.agency_timezone, not stop_timezone. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses."]

Used by trip planners to show the correct portion of the shape on a map. Values must increase along with shape_pt_sequence; they must not be used to show reverse travel along a route. Distance units must be consistent with those used in stop_times.txt. Recommended for routes that have looping or inlining (the vehicle crosses or travels over the same portion of alignment in one trip). If a vehicle retraces or crosses the route alignment at points in the course of a trip, shape_dist_traveled is important to clarify how portions of the points in shapes.txt line up correspond with records in stop_times.txt."]
